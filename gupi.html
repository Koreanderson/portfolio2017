				<h2>Gupi</h2>
				<p>Our goal was to create a post feed, similar to applications like Tumblr and Twitter. The post feeds were limited to a group chat format, so users could have different feeds among different groups of friends.</p>
				<h3>What I Contributed</h3>
				<p>Along with collaborating with my friend to decide on a direction for the application and features, my primary role on the project was UI/UX designer and front end developer. I created the initial photoshop mockups for the application and created some interaction animations and prototypes using Marvel. Moving forward I was responsible for the front end development of the application.</p>

				<h3>What I Learned</h3>
				<p>Gupi was an extremely beneficial learning experience overall. It was my first time working with another person for a self-initiated and managed web application. I learned how important the initial planning phase is and how crucial it is to communicate with your team throughout the whole process. If I were to restart the project now, I would put much more emphasis on those two points as well as set stricter deadlines for myself.</p>
