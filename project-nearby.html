				<h2>Project Nearby Marketing Site</h2>
				<p>The Project Nearby site was a marketing site I created for an internal web application managed by Every Merchant.</p>
				<h3>What I Contributed:</h3>
				<p>My job was to take a mockup of the site from our designer and turn it into a fully functioning website. Initially the site was created  in WordPress, but I decided to rebuild the site using html, css and javascript without a CMS to decrease page load times.</p>

				<h3>What I Learned:</h3>
				<p>I learned that sometimes the requirements of the project youâ€™re working on change. Switching from a WordPress environment to a static landing page saved on page load times immensely and overall left the site less vulnerable to security issues associated with WordPress sites.</p>
