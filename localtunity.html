				<h1>Localtunity</h1>
				<p>Localtunity is a business directory and rewards platform for local businesses. A business owner can sign up to list business information, promote deals and manage customer reviews.</p>
				<h3>What I Contributed:</h3>
				<p>My role as the front end developer was to take photoshop mockups created by a designer (occasionally myself) and implement the design as a functional html component or page. I would then collaborate with the other developers to make sure that all the I was handing off was understood.</p>

				<h3>What I Learned:</h3>
				<p>Working on the Localtunity application gave me a better sense of working in a version controlled environment with development, production and feature branches. The scale of the application made team collaboration much more important as well.</p>
